# Helper System to Convert an STIB-based Linux device to Yocto-based One

This repository pulls together several other repositories to produce a small,
lightweight initramfs-based Linux system that can be used to migrate
an [STIB-based](https://github.com/chargebyte/stib) device to a
[Yocto-based](https://github.com/chargebyte/chargebyte-bsp/) system.

The principle can be used with every STIB-based device, but the focus here is
on converting [EVAcharge SE](https://chargebyte.com/controllers-and-modules/evse-controllers/evacharge-se)
devices.
